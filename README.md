It will open the context menu on the screen. Press ![O button](https://github.com/bucanero/pkgi-ps3/raw/master/data/CIRCLE.png) to return to the list.
 - To reload the list, press ![Square](https://github.com/bucanero/pkgi-ps3/raw/master/data/SQUARE.png).
 - Press <kbd>L1</kbd>/<kbd>L2</kbd> or <kbd>R1</kbd>/<kbd>R2</kbd> trigger buttons to move pages up or down.

# Building

You need to have installed:

- [Open Orbis SDK](https://github.com/OpenOrbis/OpenOrbis-PS4-Toolchain/)
- [cJSON](https://github.com/bucanero/cJSON) library
- [Zip](https://github.com/bucanero/zip) library
- [SDL2](https://github.com/PacBrew/SDL/tree/ps4) library
- [libJbc](https://github.com/bucanero/ps4-libjbc) library
- [Mini-XML](https://github.com/bucanero/mxml) library
- [PolarSSL](https://github.com/bucanero/oosdk_libraries/tree/master/polarssl-1.3.9) library
- [libcurl](https://github.com/bucanero/oosdk_libraries/tree/master/curl-7.64.1) library
- [dbglogger](https://github.com/bucanero/dbglogger) library (required for debug logging)

Run `make` to create a release build. If you want to include the latest save patches in your `.pkg` file, run `make createzip`.

You can also set the `PS3LOAD` environment variable to your PS4 IP address: `export PS3LOAD=tcp:x.x.x.x`.
This will allow you to use `make run` and send `eboot.bin` directly to the [PS4Load listener](https://github.com/bucanero/ps4load).

To enable debug logging, build it with `make DEBUGLOG=1`. The application will send debug messages to
UDP multicast address `239.255.0.100:30000`. To receive them you can use [socat][] on your computer:

```
$ socat udp4-recv:30000,ip-add-membership=239.255.0.100:0.0.0.0 -
```
